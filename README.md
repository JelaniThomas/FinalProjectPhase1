# Microsoft Wants To Start MicroMovies Streaming Service Company

#### Author: Jelani Thomas

## Business Problem
Microsoft has decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. My team has been hired to help them better understand the movie industry.   

## Data 
Due to COVID, we decided to utilize the pre-COVID [Top 100 highest grossing box office numbers of 2019](https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/worldwide/all-movies/cumulative/released-in-2019) for our analysis. With this, we'll be able to demonstrate where Microsoft should invest their resources for starting MicroMovies.

## Our Findings

### Most of the highest grossing films get anywhere between 40% - 100% of their revenue from international box office.

### Most of the highest grossing films are also a part of a franchise or a remake (selling nostalgia).

### With international being so significant in the success of a film, if MicroMovies were to start a film that wasn't already a part of an established franchise or a remake, it would still be a good use of resourses. Films that were not a part of a franchise had over 70% of it's revenue come from international box office.

### G Rated movies performed by far the best in terms of the highest grossing films on average across the board.

## Key Takeaways 
Based on the analysis, these are the recommendations my team have for starting MicroMovies: 
1. The film script, characters, and theme need to appeal to an international audience. 
2. MicroMovies should do some research on shows, movies or books that could be adapted into a film.
3. In the MicroMovies search, they should prioritze films that are G rated.

## Next Steps

Micro Movies should do research on which international countries account for the highest percentage of international box office share.
