# Microsoft Wants To Start MicroFilms Streaming Service Company

#### Author: Jelani Thomas

# Business Problem
Microsoft has decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. My team has been hired to help them better understand the movie industry. Due to COVID, we decided to utilize the pre-COVID Top 100 highest grossing box office numbers of 2019 for our analysis. With this, we'll be able to demnstrate where Microsoft should invest their resources for starting MicroFilms.  

## Our Findings

### Most of the highest grossing films get anywhere between 40% - 100% of their revenue from international box office.

### Most of the highest grossing films are also a part of a franchise or a remake (selling nostalgia).
